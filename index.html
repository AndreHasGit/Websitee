     1.  Natural simulations <br>
        <br>
        Another big portion of this course was on learning Natural Simulations    <br>
        by Dan Shiffman on Khan Academy. Main stuff that was went through   <br>
        was noise vectors, oscillations and other things. The image I have right here   <br>
        is of the project paint splatter and I think is my best piece of work because I   <br>
        did not understand how to do this but then I viewed others and got inspired and used   <br>
        other pain splatter projects as a template of what to do then learned and did the project   <br>
        and I think it was done very well and more interactive than others. Even though I used others    <br>
        code to help me it taught me a lot and about not just doing the work but doing the work to learn   <br>
        and do more than is expected. You can see the code for this project on the left.
