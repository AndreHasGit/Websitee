        Below are the top ten moduels that I have completed out of the 11. I also completed half of two other moduels. <br>
        <br>
     1.  Natural simulations <br>
        <br>
        Another big portion of this course was on learning Natural Simulations    <br>
        by Dan Shiffman on Khan Academy. Main stuff that was went through   <br>
        was noise vectors, oscillations and other things. I had an insane amount of fun with <br>
        the projects in this moduel as it was interesting to "re-learn everything again.    <br>
        This moduel laid down some foundatiuons of knowledge. I completed this entire moduel  <br>
        
     2. Algorithms<br>
        <br>
       I have completed the entire Algorithms unit on Khan Academy, including all the challenges<br>
        and projects.In this module I had learned a lot about binary search and recersian and many <br>
        sorting types. Algorithms are one of the most important tools in game develepment and I am<br>
        glad that I have started my learning early.<br>
        
   3. Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation<br>
        <br>
      I have also finished the Intro to JS: Drawing and Animation lesson on Khan Academy. In this I have<br>
        learned a lot of different code like objects, functions and more. Here I have drawn a house according<br>
        to the project given to me. Here we have many different objects together to make a image/ building of <br>
        a house. This was really fun as it opened up the creativity side of coding and it was fun to just simply <br>
        build a house.<br>
        
    4. Intro to HTML/CSS: Making webpages <br>
<br>
      Furthermore, I have finished the HTML/JS: Making webpages module on Khan Academy.This module is essentially <br>
        used to help someone complete this webpage right here. I also found the styling aspect very intriguing and was<br>
        fun to do and deal with. Text properties are also very interesting. Honestley websites are not even that hard to learn<br>
        ,it just takes some time and patience. <br>
    
     5. HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive<br>
        <br>
      I have also done all of the HTML/JS: Making Webpages Interactive module on Khan Academy. In this I learned to add on to<br>
        the HTML making webpages. This model basiccally expands on the intro to html moduel. Its interesting to see how many things <br>
        that you can modify and change.<br>
        
     6. Intro to SQL: Querying and managing data<br>
        <br>
      In the intro to SQL: Querying and managing I have fully finished the module. I learned to use SQL to store, query, and <br>
        manipulate data. I took a Data managment course, so the things I learned here are pretty similar to what we went through<br>
        in that course as well. It was cool to see the similarities between the two.<br>
        
      7. Advanced JS: Games & Visualizations    <br>
            <br>
        In this module Advanced JS: Games & Visualizations a lot of different techniques were taught for us to understand multi     <br>
        scene programs and scored games. i think this model would have on of the biggist impacts for me as I want to persue game    <br>
        develepment as a career.     <br>
        
        8. HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive with jQuery<br>
<br>
        In this fully completed module HTML/JS: Making webpages interactive with jQuery we learn a further understanding on how<br>
        to make your webpage more interactive. The projects in this one were pretty complicated for me. I had to turn to the internet<br>
        to see how other people had done the projects. It was ineresting to see the variety of the solutions.<br>
      
       9. Intermediate Algorithm Scripting<br>
        <br>
        I really liked this course because I had to apply all kinds of thinking to the problems that were presented. FreeCodeCamp is<br> 
        also a new source of information that I have never used before, and I think its a good source. The information that I learned<br>
        here can be applied to future game development.<br>
      
       10. Object Oriented Programming<br>
        <br>
        In this completed free code camp module of Object Oriented Programming I learned further about organizing code into object <br>
        definitions. These are classes and what they do is group data together. This was a really fun course as well, I think that <br>
        FreeCodeCamp provides a fun environment.<br>
